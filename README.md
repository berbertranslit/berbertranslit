### Orthographic Transliteration for Kabyle Speech Recognition

This repo contains code to evaluate the results of the paper "Orthographic Translateration for Kabyle Speech Recognition" accepted to (ICNLSP 2021)[http://icnlsp.org/icnlsp2021/].

Abstract:
Training on graphemes alone without phonemes simplifies the speech-to-text pipeline. However, models respond differently to training on graphemes of different writing systems. We investigate the impact of differences between Latin and Tifinagh orthographies on automatic speech recognition quality on a Kabyle Berber speech corpus. 
We train on a corpus represented in a Latin orthography marked for vowels and gemination and subsequently transliterate model output to a consonantal Tifinagh orthography not marked for these features, which results in 10\% absolute improvement in word error rate over a model trained on the unmarked orthography. 
We find that this performance gain is primarily due to a reduced error rate for graphemes marked for vocalic and voiced consonantal phonemes.
Our results suggest that speech-to-text corpora for languages
with alternative defective orthographies 
may lead to better model quality 
by being fully marked for vowels and gemination.
